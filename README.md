### ðŸŽ“ About Me  
I am a fully-funded PhD student in Computer Science at Newcastle University. I received a Bachelor's degree in Finance & Economics from universities in mainland China & Taiwan Exchange. After working for three years at one of China's top-four banks and a top-ten securities firm, I changed to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science at Durham University (average 78%). I am a student member of IEEE. More details in https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/quinnelin.html

Interestsï¼š
1. Reducing hallucination and improving factual grounding in LLMs
2. Building LLM agents that can reason, plan, and act in open-ended environments
3. Prompting, fine-tuning, and evaluation of LLMs for real-world applications
4. Integrating LLMs into interactive systems and tools (e.g., RAG, tool-use, multi-agent collaboration)
5. Exploring responsible and explainable AI, especially in multilingual and cross-cultural settings

I consider myself an LLM engineer and applied researcher, with a keen interest in aligning generative AI systems with human needs and real-world challenges.
