- Hi, This is @YanLin-Quinne Lalaland. When I'm at my most helpless, I always draw strength from the code.
- I am a fully funded PhD student in AI (starting October 2024) and a Master of Data Science graduate from Durham University (2022-2023). I have a BSc in Economics from China and have worked in the financial sector for almost three years.
- My PhD research is about applying AI (especially the machine learning part) in interdisciplinary field research, actively exploring.
- As a hobby, I have previously successfully built cricket prediction models, eco-poetry conversation bots, social media sentiment analysis, and other small projects.
